# Identification of discrete neural patterns in C Elegans
[Project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1092DaciJ5WI4t-BOiSNkbwypdj1RlHfMd1-nDbJEUvA/edit#). The goal is to identify how [Kim et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00008/full)'s C elegans graded-potential neural model can result in discrete outcomes (E.g. Spikes, Bistability).

The neural model source code, along with the datasets, was adapted from [Kim et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00008/full)'s [github](https://github.com/shlizee/C-elegans-Neural-Interactome)
